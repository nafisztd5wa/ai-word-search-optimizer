# AI Word Search Optimizer

An system that implements multiple AI algorithms to efficiently search for target words within a constrained lexical space.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of various AI and algorithmic approaches to solve complex word search optimization problems. It features a graphical interface built with Pygame and utilizes multiple sophisticated algorithms to intelligently narrow down potential solutions.

## Technical Approaches

### Implemented AI Methods

- **Bayesian Inference**
  - Utilizes probabilistic reasoning and conditional probability
  - Updates beliefs based on new evidence through Bayesian updating
  - Analyzes letter frequency distributions to make informed predictions

- **Minimax Algorithm**
  - Employs game theory concepts to optimize decision-making
  - Minimizes the maximum possible loss in worst-case scenarios
  - Particularly effective when working with smaller search spaces

- **A* Search Algorithm**
  - Implements heuristic-based path finding to optimize search efficiency
  - Uses a combination of path cost and estimated distance to goal
  - Balances exploration and exploitation through custom heuristic functions

- **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) Approach**
  - Models the word search as a constraint satisfaction problem
  - Efficiently prunes search space using constraint propagation
  - Implements backtracking search with forward checking

- **Hybrid Approaches**
  - **Three-Stage Hybrid**: Dynamically switches between Bayesian, A*, and Minimax based on search space size
  - **CSP-A* Hybrid**: Combines constraint satisfaction with heuristic search
  - **CSP-Bayesian Hybrid**: Integrates probabilistic inference with constraint-based filtering
